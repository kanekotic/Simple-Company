# Simple-Company

An example on how to run your company web with a minimal investment. Thid comes from my experience on setting a few web pages and also running my own consultancy a few years ago.

## Domain 

is very easy to get a domain for a good price while you are not very picky in a specific name. 

You can get a domain from [Ionos](http://ionos.com/). `.com` domains from here are 1$ the first year (next years is 15$ to keep it). You get a domain an as many subdomains as you will need in reality.

## Webpage

If your intention is to publicise your services the simplest solution is to have a static webpage. This are basically generation of HTML from a set of information you want to share. You can se an example in ()[].

## Email

You should brand your emails. Normally your domain service will provide this ability. Ionos gives you one email account. nevertheless if you expect to need more than one you can either pay more or use email redirection as you can create more than one email adress without inbox.  

Redirection emails are very important as they can be used to send information to more than one person at the time. an example if there are multiple founders `contact@yourdomain.com` can send email to all of them, meaining the contact form onm your page can notify all the founders at the same time.
